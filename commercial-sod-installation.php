                        We specialize exclusively in sod installation and do not provide ongoing maintenance services. However, we do provide detailed care instructions for the critical establishment period (first 30 days) and can recommend trusted commercial landscape maintenance providers in the Jacksonville area who can maintain your new sod after installation.

                        Proper irrigation is critical for successful sod establishment. During our site evaluation, we assess your property's existing irrigation system and make recommendations for any necessary adjustments or repairs to ensure optimal coverage for your new sod. If your property doesn't have an irrigation system, we can suggest temporary irrigation solutions or recommend irrigation contractors who can install a permanent system prior to sod installation.

                        Absolutely. We understand that commercial projects often have strict timelines and scheduling requirements. Our team is experienced in working within defined project schedules and coordinating with other contractors and trades. We can also accommodate phased installations for larger commercial properties to minimize disruption to your operations. During the planning phase, we'll work closely with your project manager to develop a detailed installation schedule that aligns with your project timeline.

                        What is your warranty policy for commercial sod installation?

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        We stand behind the quality of our installation work. Our standard commercial warranty covers installation defects and workmanship issues. Since the health of the sod after installation depends largely on proper maintenance and watering, which is typically the responsibility of the property owner or their maintenance contractor, the warranty does not cover sod failure due to inadequate watering, maintenance, or acts of nature. We provide detailed care instructions to help ensure your new sod establishes successfully.

                        Our commercial payment terms typically include a deposit to secure your installation date, with the balance due upon completion. For larger commercial projects, we can offer progress billing based on completed phases. We accept commercial checks, ACH transfers, and major credit cards. For established commercial clients and property management companies, we offer Net 30 terms upon approval. All payment terms are clearly outlined in our commercial proposals.

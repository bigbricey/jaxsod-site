# Seasonal Lawn Care Calendar for North Florida

Maintaining a beautiful lawn in Jacksonville and North Florida requires understanding our unique climate patterns and adapting your lawn care practices throughout the year. Unlike northern states with their distinct four seasons, our subtropical climate creates different lawn care challenges and opportunities. This comprehensive month-by-month guide will help you keep your lawn healthy, green, and thriving all year long.

North Florida's climate features hot, humid summers, mild winters with occasional freezes, and transitional spring and fall seasons. Our warm-season grasses like St. Augustine, Zoysia, and Bahia thrive during the warm months but may go dormant during winter cold snaps. By following this seasonal calendar, you'll provide your lawn with the right care at the right time, preventing common problems and maximizing your lawn's potential.

## January: Winter Lawn Protection

January in Jacksonville typically brings cooler temperatures with occasional freezes. While your warm-season grass may be dormant or semi-dormant, there are still important tasks to complete.

### Key Tasks for January

* **Monitor for Winter Weeds**: Cool-season weeds like chickweed, henbit, and annual bluegrass can invade dormant lawns. Hand-pull isolated weeds or spot-treat with appropriate herbicides.

* **Limited Mowing**: If your lawn remains green, mow occasionally at a slightly higher height than summer (raise mower ½ inch). Many lawns will not need mowing during this period.

* **Irrigation Management**: Reduce watering to once every 10-14 days if no rainfall occurs. Water in the mid-morning to allow time for drying before evening.

* **Equipment Maintenance**: Service your lawn mower and other equipment while demands are low. Sharpen mower blades, change oil, and ensure everything is ready for spring.

* **Avoid Fertilization**: Do not apply nitrogen fertilizers during winter months as this can stimulate tender growth that is susceptible to cold damage.

### Winter Lawn Protection Tips

If freezing temperatures are predicted:

* Water the lawn 24-48 hours before the freeze (not the day of) to help insulate root systems
* Avoid walking on frost-covered grass to prevent damage
* Do not attempt to remove frost from the lawn
* Be patient with brown areas after a freeze – most lawns will recover when temperatures warm

## February: Preparing for Spring

February is a transitional month in North Florida, with temperatures beginning to warm but still potential for cold snaps. This is the time to prepare for the upcoming growing season.

### Key Tasks for February

* **Soil Testing**: Collect soil samples and send them to your local UF/IFAS Extension office for analysis. This allows time to make necessary amendments before spring growth.

* **Inspect for Damage**: Assess any winter damage to your lawn and make notes of areas that may need repair in spring.

* **Weed Control**: Apply pre-emergent herbicide by mid-February to prevent warm-season weeds. Follow product instructions carefully and select one appropriate for your grass type.

* **Light Raking**: Gently rake dormant lawns to remove debris and dead material, improving air circulation and preparing for new growth.

* **Irrigation System Check**: Test your irrigation system, clean filters, check for leaks, and adjust heads to ensure proper coverage for the coming growing season.

### Planning for Spring

* Create a lawn care plan based on soil test results
* Research any new products or techniques you want to implement
* Purchase supplies before the spring rush
* Consider areas that might need renovation or re-sodding

## March: Spring Wake-Up

March typically brings warmer temperatures and the beginning of spring green-up for most Jacksonville lawns. This is when your lawn begins to emerge from dormancy and enter active growth.

### Key Tasks for March

* **Initial Fertilization**: Apply the first fertilizer of the season after your lawn shows signs of active growth (not before). Use a complete fertilizer with a 3:1:2 or 4:1:2 ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

* **Mowing Resumption**: Begin regular mowing as growth accelerates. Set your mower at the proper height for your grass type:
  * St. Augustine: 3.5-4 inches
  * Zoysia: 1.5-2.5 inches (varies by variety)
  * Bahia: 3-4 inches
  * Centipede: 1.5-2 inches

* **Thatch Assessment**: Check thatch levels in your lawn. If thatch exceeds ½ inch, plan for dethatching or core aeration in late spring.

* **Irrigation Adjustment**: Increase watering to twice per week if rainfall is insufficient, following local water restrictions.

* **Spot-Leveling**: Address minor low spots with a top dressing of similar soil material (not more than ½ inch at a time).

### Spring Transition Tips

* Don't fertilize too early – wait until the lawn is actively growing
* Sharpen mower blades for a clean cut that reduces disease risk
* Begin monitoring for early-season pests like mole crickets
* Apply iron supplements if your lawn shows yellowing but is otherwise healthy

## April: Active Spring Growth

April brings consistent warm temperatures and typically accelerated lawn growth. This is a critical month for establishing good practices that will benefit your lawn throughout the growing season.

### Key Tasks for April

* **Regular Mowing**: Establish a consistent mowing schedule, never removing more than ⅓ of the grass height at once. Mow frequently enough to maintain this rule.

* **Pest Monitoring**: Begin regular inspections for chinch bugs, mole crickets, and sod webworms. Look for irregular brown patches or damaged grass blades.

* **Fertilization**: If you didn't fertilize in March, apply a slow-release nitrogen fertilizer early this month. Follow UF/IFAS recommendations for your specific grass type.

* **Weed Management**: Apply post-emergent herbicides as needed for broadleaf weeds. Ensure products are labeled for your grass type and follow application instructions carefully.

* **Irrigation Management**: Adjust irrigation as needed based on rainfall and temperature. Typically, ¾ inch of water twice per week is sufficient if no rainfall occurs.

### Lawn Stress Prevention

* Avoid afternoon mowing during hot days
* Ensure mower blades remain sharp throughout the growing season
* Consider leaving clippings on the lawn to return nutrients (unless disease is present)
* Begin training your lawn to develop deeper roots by watering deeply but less frequently

## May: Late Spring Maintenance

May in Jacksonville typically brings higher temperatures and the beginning of our rainy season. Your lawn is now in full active growth and requires regular maintenance.

### Key Tasks for May

* **Fertilization**: Apply a second round of fertilizer if your grass shows signs of nutrient deficiency. Use a slow-release product to prevent rapid growth and potential thatch buildup.

* **Insect Control**: Monitor for and treat chinch bugs in St. Augustine lawns, particularly in sunny, stressed areas. Follow integrated pest management practices, treating only affected areas when possible.

* **Irrigation Adjustment**: As temperatures increase, ensure your lawn receives 1-1.5 inches of water per week from either rainfall or irrigation. Adjust automatic systems based on natural rainfall.

* **Mowing Height**: Consider raising the mowing height slightly as temperatures increase to reduce heat stress and encourage deeper root growth.

* **Core Aeration**: If soil is compacted or thatch exceeds ½ inch, consider core aeration this month before summer heat stress begins.

### Summer Preparation

* Apply a preventative fungicide if your lawn has a history of disease issues
* Edge beds and walkways to maintain clean lines and prevent grass invasion
* Consider micronutrient applications if soil tests indicate deficiencies
* Mulch landscape beds to reduce weed pressure and conserve moisture

## June: Early Summer Care

June brings consistent heat, humidity, and typically regular rainfall. This month begins the most challenging season for Jacksonville lawns, requiring attentive management.

### Key Tasks for June

* **Proper Watering**: Monitor rainfall and supplement with irrigation only when necessary. Overwatering during rainy season can promote disease and shallow root systems.

* **Fungus Prevention**: Watch for signs of fungal disease like brown patch or gray leaf spot, especially during humid periods. Apply fungicide preventatively in problem-prone areas.

* **Mowing Consistency**: Maintain regular mowing but avoid cutting during the hottest part of the day. Never remove more than ⅓ of the leaf blade at once.

* **Fertilization Considerations**: In most cases, avoid nitrogen fertilization during peak summer months. If your lawn shows nutrient deficiencies, use a light application of slow-release fertilizer or iron supplements.

* **Weed Management**: Continue monitoring for weeds and treat with spot applications rather than broadcast treatments during hot months.

### Summer Stress Management

> **Pro Tip:** During summer, it's better to water deeply 1-2 times per week rather than lightly every day. This encourages deeper root growth and improves drought tolerance.

* Avoid herbicide applications during extreme heat
* Consider leaving grass clippings to return nutrients and moisture to the soil
* Raise mowing height slightly to reduce heat stress
* Limit traffic on stressed areas of the lawn

## July: Peak Summer Management

July is typically the hottest month in Jacksonville, often with afternoon thunderstorms. Heat stress, insects, and diseases are the primary concerns during this period.

### Key Tasks for July

* **Heat Stress Monitoring**: Watch for signs of heat stress including wilting, folding leaf blades, or bluish-gray coloration. Water affected areas deeply in early morning.

* **Pest Control**: Continue monitoring for chinch bugs, which thrive in hot, dry conditions. Check lawn edges and sunny spots regularly.

* **Disease Management**: High humidity and temperatures create ideal conditions for fungal diseases. Monitor for circular patches, irregular growth, or discolored grass blades.

* **Limited Fertilization**: Generally avoid nitrogen fertilization during July. If yellowing occurs, consider iron applications instead of nitrogen.

* **Irrigation Efficiency**: Check irrigation system for proper coverage and adjust to account for rainfall. Early morning watering (before 10 AM) is essential.

### Dealing with Summer Rainfall

* Adjust irrigation system based on natural rainfall
* Ensure proper drainage in low-lying areas
* Consider installing rain sensors on irrigation systems
* Monitor for mushrooms, which indicate excess moisture

## August: Late Summer Vigilance

August continues the challenging summer conditions with high temperatures and humidity. Maintaining vigilance against pests and diseases remains the priority.

### Key Tasks for August

* **Continued Pest Monitoring**: Check for chinch bugs, sod webworms, and armyworms, which can cause rapid damage during late summer.

* **Selective Mowing**: Maintain regular mowing schedule but consider skipping a week during drought conditions. Keep mower blades sharp for clean cuts.

* **Irrigation Management**: Continue monitoring soil moisture and irrigate only when necessary, following water restrictions.

* **Soil Testing**: Consider a mid-season soil test if your lawn is performing poorly despite proper care.

* **Fall Planning**: Begin planning for fall renovation of damaged areas.

### Preparing for Fall Transition

* Identify areas that may need renovation or overseeding
* Monitor for tropical storms and prepare lawn accordingly
* Begin researching fall fertilizer options based on summer performance
* Consider soil amendments that might be needed based on soil test results

## September: Early Fall Transition

September brings slightly cooler temperatures and the beginning of the transition to fall. This is an excellent time to help your lawn recover from summer stress.

### Key Tasks for September

* **Fall Fertilization**: Apply a complete fertilizer with a balanced N-P-K ratio to help the lawn recover from summer stress and prepare for winter.

* **Calibrated Watering**: Adjust irrigation as temperatures moderate and growth slows. Typically reduce to once per week if rainfall is insufficient.

* **Weed Prevention**: Apply pre-emergent herbicide to prevent cool-season annual weeds before they germinate.

* **Renovation**: Repair damaged areas with sod or plugs while there's still enough warm weather for establishment.

* **Soil Amendment**: Address soil issues identified in tests, such as pH adjustment with lime or sulfur applications.

### Recovery Strategies

* Core aeration can help stressed lawns recover by improving root growth
* Top-dressing with compost can improve soil structure and provide nutrients
* Reduce mowing frequency as growth slows
* Begin lowering mowing height gradually (no more than ¼ inch per week)

## October: Fall Lawn Strengthening

October brings cooler temperatures and less rainfall, creating good conditions for lawn recovery and strengthening before winter.

### Key Tasks for October

* **Final Fertilization**: Apply the last fertilizer of the season, using a product with higher potassium to improve cold hardiness. Follow UF/IFAS guidelines for timing.

* **Irrigation Adjustment**: Reduce watering frequency as temperatures cool and growth slows. Water deeply when needed rather than frequently.

* **Mowing Height**: Begin gradually lowering the mowing height to prepare for winter, but never remove more than ⅓ of the leaf blade at once.

* **Leaf Management**: Remove fallen leaves promptly to prevent smothering the lawn and creating disease conditions.

* **Weed Control**: Address any persistent weeds before they establish for winter.

### Winter Preparation

* Ensure irrigation systems are functioning properly before potential freezes
* Consider applying a preventative fungicide if your lawn has a history of winter disease
* Clean up garden debris that could harbor pests or diseases
* Reduce traffic on the lawn as growth slows

## November: Pre-Winter Care

November brings cooler temperatures and the potential for occasional frost. Growth slows significantly, and the lawn begins preparing for dormancy.

### Key Tasks for November

* **Limited Mowing**: Continue mowing as needed, but frequency will decrease significantly. Maintain proper height for your grass type.

* **Irrigation Reduction**: Reduce watering to every 10-14 days if no rainfall occurs. Water in the morning to allow time for drying.

* **Leaf Removal**: Continue removing fallen leaves to prevent lawn damage and disease.

* **Equipment Winterization**: Clean and store summer lawn equipment properly. Drain gas or add stabilizer to mower.

* **Avoid Fertilization**: Do not apply nitrogen fertilizers after October in North Florida.

### Cold Protection Planning

* Check weather forecasts regularly for freeze warnings
* Have frost cloth or blankets ready for sensitive landscape plants
* Know which irrigation zones cover the most cold-sensitive areas
* Ensure hoses and outdoor faucets are protected from freezing

## December: Winter Lawn Protection

December brings cooler temperatures and the highest likelihood of freezes. The lawn is typically semi-dormant or dormant, requiring minimal care.

### Key Tasks for December

* **Minimal Irrigation**: Water only during extended dry periods, approximately every 14-21 days if no rainfall occurs.

* **Limited Traffic**: Minimize traffic on dormant or semi-dormant lawns to prevent damage.

* **Weed Management**: Hand-pull winter weeds as they appear to prevent spreading.

* **Cold Protection**: Be prepared to protect irrigation components during freezes.

* **Planning**: Use this downtime to plan next year's lawn care calendar and research new techniques or products.

### Winter Lawn Tips

* Avoid fertilizing or applying chemicals during winter months
* Do not attempt to overseed warm-season lawns with cool-season grasses in North Florida
* Keep leaves and debris cleared from the lawn
* Avoid pruning cold-damaged grass until spring green-up

## Annual Lawn Care Best Practices

* Never remove more than ⅓ of the grass height in a single mowing
* Alternate mowing patterns to prevent ruts and compaction
* Consider grasscycling (leaving clippings) during the growing season

### Efficient Irrigation Practices

* Water deeply and infrequently rather than lightly and frequently
* Irrigate in early morning (before 10 AM)
* Adjust irrigation based on rainfall and season
* Conduct regular irrigation audits to ensure even coverage

### Integrated Pest Management

* Identify pests correctly before treating
* Use cultural practices as the first line of defense
* Apply pesticides only when necessary and target specific areas
* Follow all label directions for timing and application rates

### Soil Health Maintenance

* Test soil every 2-3 years
* Address pH issues promptly

* Consider annual core aeration for heavily used lawns

## Common Questions About Seasonal Lawn Care

**When is the best time to fertilize my Jacksonville lawn?**
The primary fertilization windows for North Florida lawns are March/April (after spring green-up begins) and September/October (for recovery and winter preparation). Avoid fertilizing during peak summer heat and winter dormancy periods. Always follow UF/IFAS recommendations for your specific grass type.

**Should I water my lawn during winter months?**
Yes, but much less frequently. Even dormant lawns need occasional moisture for root health. Water every 10-14 days during winter if no rainfall occurs, preferably in the morning to allow time for drying before evening.

**When should I apply pre-emergent herbicides in North Florida?**
For summer annual weed prevention, apply pre-emergent herbicides in late February to early March. For winter annual weed prevention, apply in early October. Timing is critical for effectiveness, as these products must be applied before weed seeds germinate.

**How do I know if my lawn has chinch bugs?**
Look for yellowing or browning patches that expand over time, typically in sunny, drier areas. These patches will not green up with irrigation. Confirm by using the "float test": remove both ends of a coffee can, push it into the soil at the edge of a damaged area, fill with water, and watch for small black insects with white markings floating to the surface.

**Should I bag my grass clippings?**
In most cases, no. Returning clippings to the lawn (grasscycling) recycles nutrients and does not contribute to thatch if mowing is done properly. Only bag clippings if the lawn has active disease or if mowing has been delayed and clippings are excessive.

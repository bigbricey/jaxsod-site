                        Most residential sod installation projects can be completed in 1-2 days, depending on the size and complexity of your yard. Small to medium-sized installations (under 5,000 square feet) are typically completed in a single day, while larger properties may require additional time. During your consultation, we'll provide a specific timeline for your project.

                        While sod can be installed year-round in Jacksonville's mild climate, the optimal time is during the growing season from late spring through early fall (April through October). This allows the sod to establish quickly in warm soil temperatures. We generally avoid installations during extreme heat or drought conditions, which can stress new sod. Winter installations are possible but may take longer to establish roots.

                        Residential sod installation costs vary depending on several factors including yard size, sod variety, site preparation needs, and accessibility. In the Jacksonville area, professional sod installation typically ranges from $1.75-$3.50 per square foot, which includes removal of old grass, soil preparation, sod materials, and expert installation. We provide detailed, transparent pricing in our free estimates with no hidden fees or surprises.

                        You can walk lightly on newly installed sod to perform necessary maintenance like watering, but minimize traffic for the first 2-3 weeks. Avoid heavy foot traffic, pets, and play activities until the sod has rooted into the soil beneath (typically 2-3 weeks in summer, longer in cooler months). The first mowing can usually be done 10-14 days after installation, once the grass reaches 3-4 inches in height.

                        Proper watering is crucial during the establishment period. Water newly installed sod 2-3 times daily for the first week (approximately 15-20 minutes per section), then gradually reduce to once daily in the second week, and then to 2-3 times per week by the third week. Wait to mow until the grass reaches 3-4 inches (typically 10-14 days after installation), and avoid applying fertilizer for at least 30 days. We provide detailed care instructions tailored to your specific installation and Jacksonville's seasonal conditions.
